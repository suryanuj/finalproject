# Final Project
Final Project for CISC210H (Introduction to Systems Programming Honors) at the University of Delaware.

**About**: 
>In this program, we created a client and server that allows one to connect two raspberry pi's together and exchange information, such as the temperature, pressure, and humidity. This project allowed us to practice C Programming Language, how clients and servers work, and how the raspberry pi can be used.
